Starts the MySQL database server.

Usage: mysqld [OPTIONS]

Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
/etc/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf /usr/etc/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf 
The following groups are read: mysql_cluster mysqld server mysqld-8.0
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults        Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults           Don't read default options from any option file,
                        except for login file.
--defaults-file=#       Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=#
                        Also read groups with concat(group, suffix)
--login-path=#          Read this path from the login file.

  --abort-slave-event-count=# 
                      Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
                      replication.This option is deprecated and will be removed
                      in a future version. 
  --activate-all-roles-on-login 
                      Automatically set all granted roles as active after the
                      user has authenticated successfully.
  --admin-address=name 
                      IP address to bind to for service connection. Address can
                      be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or host name. Wildcard
                      values *, ::, 0.0.0.0 are not allowed. Address value can
                      have following optional network namespace separated by
                      the delimiter / from the address value. E.g., the
                      following value 192.168.1.1/red specifies IP addresses to
                      listen for incoming TCP connections that have to be
                      placed into the namespace 'red'. Using of network
                      namespace requires its support from underlying Operating
                      System. Attempt to specify a network namespace for a
                      platform that doesn't support it results in error during
                      socket creation.
  --admin-port=#      Port number to use for service connection, built-in
                      default (33062)
  --admin-ssl         Enable SSL for admin interface (automatically enabled
                      with other flags).
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-admin-ssl to disable.)
  --admin-ssl-ca=name CA file in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl)
                      for --admin-port
  --admin-ssl-capath=name 
                      CA directory (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl) for
                      --admin-port
  --admin-ssl-cert=name 
                      X509 cert in PEM format (implies --ssl) for --admin-port
  --admin-ssl-cipher=name 
                      SSL cipher to use (implies --ssl) for --admin-port
  --admin-ssl-crl=name 
                      CRL file in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies
                      --ssl) for --admin-port
  --admin-ssl-crlpath=name 
                      CRL directory (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl) for
                      --admin-port
  --admin-ssl-key=name 
                      X509 key in PEM format (implies --ssl) for --admin-port
  --admin-tls-ciphersuites=name 
                      TLS v1.3 ciphersuite to use (implies --ssl) for
                      --admin-port
  --admin-tls-version=name 
                      TLS version for --admin-port, permitted values are
                      TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3
  --allow-suspicious-udfs 
                      Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
                      without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
                      also means that one can load any function from any
                      library, for example exit() from libc.so
  -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
                      will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
  --archive[=name]    Enable or disable ARCHIVE plugin. Possible values are ON,
                      OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --authentication-policy=name 
                      Defines policies around how user account can be
                      configured with Multi Factor authentication methods
                      during CREATE/ALTER USER statement. This variable accepts
                      at-most 3 comma separated list of authentication plugin
                      names where each value refers to what authentication
                      plugin should be used in place of 1st Factor
                      Authentication (FA), 2FA and 3FA method. Value *
                      indicates any plugin is allowed for 1FA, 2FA and 3FA
                      method. An empty value means nth FA method is optional.
  --auto-generate-certs 
                      Auto generate SSL certificates at server startup if --ssl
                      is set to ON and none of the other SSL system variables
                      are specified and certificate/key files are not present
                      in data directory.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-auto-generate-certs to disable.)
  --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
                      Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
  --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
                      Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
                      auto-increment-increment != 1
  --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
  --automatic-sp-privileges 
                      Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
  --avoid-temporal-upgrade 
                      When this option is enabled, the pre-5.6.4 temporal types
                      are not upgraded to the new format for ALTER TABLE
                      requests ADD/CHANGE/MODIFY COLUMN, ADD INDEX or FORCE
                      operation. This variable is deprecated and will be
                      removed in a future release.
  --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can
                      have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
                      gets very many connection requests in a very short time
  -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
                      resolved relative to this
  --big-tables        Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on
                      file (Solves most 'table full' errors)
  --bind-address=name IP address(es) to bind to. Syntax: address[,address]...,
                      where address can be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, host
                      name or one of the wildcard values *, ::, 0.0.0.0. In
                      case more than one address is specified in a
                      comma-separated list, wildcard values are not allowed.
                      Every address can have optional network namespace
                      separated by the delimiter / from the address value.
                      E.g., the following value
                      192.168.1.1/red,172.16.1.1/green,193.168.1.1 specifies
                      three IP addresses to listen for incoming TCP connections
                      two of that have to be placed in corresponding
                      namespaces: the address 192.168.1.1 must be placed into
                      the namespace red and the address 172.16.1.1 must be
                      placed into the namespace green. Using of network
                      namespace requires its support from underlying Operating
                      System. Attempt to specify a network namespace for a
                      platform that doesn't support it results in error during
                      socket creation.
  --binlog-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the transactional cache for updates to
                      transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
                      use transactions containing many statements, you can
                      increase this to get more performance
  --binlog-checksum=name 
                      Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
                      events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
                      CRC32; default is CRC32.
  --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
                      Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
                      statement format to be written directly to binary log,
                      after executing them and before committing the
                      transaction. Before using this option make sure that
                      there are no dependencies between transactional and
                      non-transactional tables such as in the statement INSERT
                      INTO t_myisam SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, replicas
                      may diverge.
  --binlog-do-db=name Include only updates to the specified database when
                      writing the binary log.
  --binlog-encryption Enable/disable binary and relay logs encryption.
  --binlog-error-action=name 
                      When statements cannot be written to the binary log due
                      to a fatal error, this option determines whether the
                      server ignores the error and closes the binary log, or
                      aborts.
  --binlog-expire-logs-auto-purge 
                      Controls whether the server shall automatically purge
                      binary log files or not. If this variable is set to FALSE
                      then the server will not purge binary log files
                      automatically.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-expire-logs-auto-purge to disable.)
  --binlog-expire-logs-seconds=# 
                      If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
                      binlog_expire_logs_seconds seconds; If both this option
                      and expire_logs_days are set to non-zero  values, this
                      option takes priority. Purges happen at startup and at
                      binary log rotation.
  --binlog-format=name 
                      The format used when writing the binary log. ROW writes
                      each changed row in a binary format. STATEMENT writes SQL
                      statements. MIXED writes SQL statements for most
                      statements, and row format for statements that cannot be
                      replayed in a deterministic manner using SQL. If
                      NDBCLUSTER is enabled and binlog-format is MIXED, the
                      format switches to row-based and back implicitly for each
                      query accessing an NDBCLUSTER table.
  --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay=# 
                      The number of microseconds the server waits for the
                      binary log group commit sync queue to fill before
                      continuing. Default: 0. Min: 0. Max: 1000000.
  --binlog-group-commit-sync-no-delay-count=# 
                      If there are this many transactions in the commit sync
                      queue and the server is waiting for more transactions to
                      be enqueued (as set using
                      --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay), the commit procedure
                      resumes.
  --binlog-gtid-simple-recovery 
                      If this option is enabled, the server does not open more
                      than two binary logs when initializing GTID_PURGED and
                      GTID_EXECUTED, either during server restart or when
                      binary logs are being purged. Enabling this option is
                      useful when the server has already generated many binary
                      logs without GTID events (e.g., having GTID_MODE = OFF).
                      Note: If this option is enabled, GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED and
                      GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED may be initialized wrongly in two
                      cases: (1) All binary logs were generated by MySQL 5.7.5
                      or older, and GTID_MODE was ON for some binary logs but
                      OFF for the newest binary log. (2) The oldest existing
                      binary log was generated by MySQL 5.7.5 or older, and SET
                      GTID_PURGED was issued after the oldest binary log was
                      generated. If a wrong set is computed in one of case (1)
                      or case (2), it will remain wrong even if the server is
                      later restarted with this option disabled.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-gtid-simple-recovery to disable.)
  --binlog-ignore-db=name 
                      Exclude updates to the specified database when writing
                      the binary log.
  --binlog-max-flush-queue-time=# 
                      The maximum time that the binary log group commit will
                      keep reading transactions before it flush the
                      transactions to the binary log (and optionally sync,
                      depending on the value of sync_binlog).
  --binlog-order-commits 
                      Issue internal commit calls in the same order as
                      transactions are written to the binary log. Default is to
                      order commits.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-order-commits to disable.)
  --binlog-rotate-encryption-master-key-at-startup 
                      Force binlog encryption master key rotation at startup
  --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
                      The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
                      bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
                      size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
  --binlog-row-image=name 
                      Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
                      'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
                      columns in the before and after image are logged.
                      'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
                      whenever possible (e.g. blob column was not changed or is
                      not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
                      equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
                      the table) is logged in the before image, and only
                      changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
                      FULL).
  --binlog-row-metadata=name 
                      Controls how much type information is written to the
                      binary log when using ROW format. FULL causes all
                      metadata to be logged. MINIMAL means that only metadata
                      actually needed by replicas is logged.
  --binlog-row-value-options=name 
                      When set to PARTIAL_JSON, this option enables a
                      space-efficient row-based binary log format for UPDATE
                      statements that modify a JSON value using only the
                      functions JSON_SET, JSON_REPLACE, and JSON_REMOVE. For
                      such updates, only the modified parts of the JSON
                      document are included in the binary log, so small changes
                      of big documents may need significantly less space.
  --binlog-rows-query-log-events 
                      Allow writing of Rows_query_log events into binary log.
  --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the statement cache for updates to
                      non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
                      often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
                      can increase this to get more performance
  --binlog-transaction-compression 
                      Whether to compress transactions or not. Transactions are
                      compressed using the ZSTD compression algorythm.
  --binlog-transaction-compression-level-zstd=# 
                      Specifies the transaction compression level for ZSTD
                      transaction compression in the binary log.
  --binlog-transaction-dependency-history-size=# 
                      Maximum number of rows to keep in the writeset history.

                      After inserting delayed_insert_limit rows, the INSERT
                      DELAYED handler will check if there are any SELECT
                      statements pending. If so, it allows these to execute
                      before continuing. This variable is deprecated along with
                      INSERT DELAYED.

                      How long a INSERT DELAYED thread should wait for INSERT
                      statements before terminating. This variable is
                      deprecated along with INSERT DELAYED.

                      What size queue (in rows) should be allocated for
                      handling INSERT DELAYED. If the queue becomes full, any
                      client that does INSERT DELAYED will wait until there is
                      room in the queue again. This variable is deprecated
                      along with INSERT DELAYED.

                      error
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-disconnect-on-expired-password to disable.)
  --disconnect-slave-event-count=# 
                      Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
                      replication.This option is deprecated and will be removed
                      in a future version.
  --div-precision-increment=# 
                      Precision of the result of '/' operator will be increased
                      on that value
  --early-plugin-load=name 
                      Optional semicolon-separated list of plugins to load
                      before storage engine initialization, where each plugin
                      is identified as name=library, where name is the plugin
                      name and library is the plugin library in plugin_dir.
  --end-markers-in-json 
                      In JSON output ("EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON" and optimizer
                      trace), if variable is set to 1, repeats the structure's
                      key (if it has one) near the closing bracket
  --enforce-gtid-consistency[=name] 
                      Prevents execution of statements that would be impossible
                      to log in a transactionally safe manner. Currently, the
                      disallowed statements include CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
                      inside transactions, all updates to non-transactional
                      tables, and CREATE TABLE ... SELECT.
  --eq-range-index-dive-limit=# 
                      The optimizer will use existing index statistics instead
                      of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of
                      equality ranges for the index is larger than or equal to
                      this number. If set to 0, index dives are always used.
  --event-scheduler[=name] 
                      Enable the event scheduler. Possible values are ON, OFF,
                      and DISABLED (keep the event scheduler completely
                      deactivated, it cannot be activated run-time)
  -T, --exit-info[=#] Used for debugging. Use at your own risk.
  --expire-logs-days=# 
                      If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
                      expire_logs_days days; If this option alone is set on the
                      command line or in a configuration file, it overrides the
                      default value for binlog-expire-logs-seconds. If both
                      options are set to nonzero values,
                      binlog-expire-logs-seconds takes priority. Possible
                      purges happen at startup and at binary log rotation.
  --explain-format[=name] 
                      The default format in which the EXPLAIN statement
                      displays information. Valid values are TRADITIONAL
                      (default), TREE, JSON and TRADITIONAL_STRICT.
                      TRADITIONAL_STRICT is only used internally by the mtr
                      test suite, and is not meant to be used anywhere else.
  --explicit-defaults-for-timestamp 
                      This option causes CREATE TABLE to create all TIMESTAMP
                      columns as NULL with DEFAULT NULL attribute, Without this
                      option, TIMESTAMP columns are NOT NULL and have implicit
                      DEFAULT clauses. The old behavior is deprecated. The
                      variable can only be set by users having the SUPER
                      privilege.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-explicit-defaults-for-timestamp to disable.)
  --external-locking  Use system (external) locking (disabled by default). 
                      With this option enabled you can run myisamchk to test
                      (not repair) tables while the MySQL server is running.
                      Disable with --skip-external-locking.
  --federated[=name]  Enable or disable FEDERATED plugin. Possible values are
                      ON, OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --flush             Flush MyISAM tables to disk between SQL commands

                      FULLTEXT index. Note: FULLTEXT indexes must be rebuilt
                      after changing this variable
  --ft-min-word-len=# The minimum length of the word to be included in a
                      FULLTEXT index. Note: FULLTEXT indexes must be rebuilt
                      after changing this variable
  --ft-query-expansion-limit=# 
                      Number of best matches to use for query expansion
  --ft-stopword-file=name 
                      Use stopwords from this file instead of built-in list
  --gdb               Set up signals usable for debugging.
  --general-log       Log connections and queries to a table or log file.
                      Defaults to logging to a file hostname.log, or if
                      --log-output=TABLE is used, to a table mysql.general_log.
  --general-log-file=name 
                      Log connections and queries to given file
  --generated-random-password-length=# 
                      Determines the length randomly generated passwords in
                      CREATE USER-,SET PASSWORD- or ALTER USER statements
  --global-connection-memory-limit=# 
                      Maximum amount of memory all connections can consume
  --global-connection-memory-tracking 
                      Enable updating the global memory counter and checking
                      the global connection memory limit exceeding
  --group-concat-max-len=# 
                      The maximum length of the result of function 
                      GROUP_CONCAT()
  --group-replication-consistency[=name] 
                      Transaction consistency guarantee, possible values:
                      EVENTUAL, BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER, BEFORE, AFTER,
                      BEFORE_AND_AFTER
  --gtid-executed-compression-period[=#] 
                      Compress the mysql.gtid_executed table whenever this
                      number of transactions have been added, by waking up a
                      foreground thread (compress_gtid_table). This compression
                      method only operates when binary logging is disabled on
                      the replica; if binary logging is enabled, the table is
                      compressed every time the binary log is rotated, and this
                      value is ignored. Before MySQL 8.0.23, the default is
                      1000, and from MySQL 8.0.23, the default is zero, which
                      disables this compression method. This is because in
                      releases from MySQL 8.0.17, InnoDB transactions are
                      written to the mysql.gtid_executed table by a separate
                      process to non-InnoDB transactions. If the server has a
                      mix of InnoDB and non-InnoDB transactions, attempting to
                      compress the table with the compress_gtid_table thread
                      can slow this process, so from MySQL 8.0.17 it is
                      recommended that you set gtid_executed_compression_period
                      to 0.
  --gtid-mode=name    Controls whether Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs)
                      are enabled. Can be OFF, OFF_PERMISSIVE, ON_PERMISSIVE,
                      or ON. OFF means that no transaction has a GTID.
                      OFF_PERMISSIVE means that new transactions (committed in
                      a client session using GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC') are not
                      assigned any GTID, and replicated transactions are
                      allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON_PERMISSIVE means
                      that new transactions are assigned a GTID, and replicated
                      transactions are allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON
                      means that all transactions have a GTID. ON is required
                      on a source before any replica can use
                      SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1. To safely switch from OFF to ON,
                      first set all servers to OFF_PERMISSIVE, then set all
                      servers to ON_PERMISSIVE, then wait for all transactions
                      without a GTID to be replicated and executed on all
                      servers, and finally set all servers to GTID_MODE = ON.

  --log-bin[=name]    Configures the name prefix to use for binary log files.
                      If the --log-bin option is not supplied, the name prefix
                      defaults to "binlog". If the --log-bin option is supplied
                      without argument, the name prefix defaults to
                      "HOSTNAME-bin", where HOSTNAME is the machine's hostname.
                      To set a different name prefix for binary log files, use
                      --log-bin=name. To disable binary logging, use the
                      --skip-log-bin or --disable-log-bin option.
  --log-bin-index=name 
                      File that holds the names for binary log files.
  --log-bin-trust-function-creators 
                      If set to FALSE (the default), then when --log-bin is
                      used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
                      allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
                      if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
                      logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
                      ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
                      do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
                      can safely set this to TRUE
  --log-bin-use-v1-row-events 
                      If equal to 1 then version 1 row events are written to a
                      row based binary log.  If equal to 0, then the latest
                      version of events are written.  This option is useful
                      during some upgrades.

                      Comma-separated list of error-codes. Error messages
                      corresponding to these codes will not be included in the
                      error log. Only events with a severity of Warning or
                      Information can be suppressed; events with System or
                      Error severity will always be included. Requires the
                      filter 'log_filter_internal' to be set in
                      @@global.log_error_services, which is the default.

  --log-replica-updates 
                      If enabled, the replication applier threads will write to
                      this server's binary log.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-log-replica-updates to disable.)
  --log-short-format  Don't log extra information to update and slow-query
                      logs.
  --log-slave-updates This option is deprecated. Use log_replica_updates

                      Log slow OPTIMIZE, ANALYZE, ALTER and other
                      administrative statements to the slow log if it is open.

                      Log slow statements executed by the replication applier
                      threads to the slow log if it is open.
  --log-slow-slave-statements 
                      This option is deprecated. Use
                      log_slow_replica_statements instead.
  --log-statements-unsafe-for-binlog 
                      Log statements considered unsafe when using statement
                      based binary logging.

                      condensed into a single summary line. A value of 0
                      disables throttling. Option has no effect unless
                      --log_queries_not_using_indexes is set.
  --log-timestamps=name 
                      UTC to timestamp log files in zulu time, for more concise
                      timestamps and easier correlation of logs from servers
                      from multiple time zones, or SYSTEM to use the system's
                      local time. This affects only log files, not log tables,
                      as the timestamp columns of the latter can be converted
                      at will.

  --ndb-log-update-as-write 
                      For efficiency log only after image as a write event.
                      Ignore before image. This may cause compatibility
                      problems if replicating to other storage engines than
                      ndbcluster.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ndb-log-update-as-write to disable.)
  --ndb-log-update-minimal 
                      For efficiency, log updates in a minimal formatLog only
                      the primary key value(s) in the before image. Log only
                      the changed columns in the after image. This may cause
                      compatibility problems if replicating to other storage
                      engines than ndbcluster.
  --ndb-log-updated-only 
                      For efficiency log only updated columns. Columns are
                      considered as "updated" even if they are updated with the
                      same value. This may cause compatibility problems if
                      replicating to other storage engines than ndbcluster.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ndb-log-updated-only to disable.)
  --ndb-metadata-check 
                      Enable the automatic detection of NDB metadata changes to
                      be synchronized with the DD
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ndb-metadata-check to disable.)
  --ndb-metadata-check-interval=# 
                      Interval of time (in seconds) at which a check is done to
                      see if there are NDB metadata changes to be synchronized
  --ndb-metadata-sync Triggers immediate synchronization of all changes between
                      NDB Dictionary and MySQL server. Setting this option
                      results in the values of ndb_metadata_check and
                      ndb_metadata_check_interval being ignored. Automatically
                      resets to false when the synchronization has completed
  --ndb-mgmd-host=name 
                      Same as --ndb-connectstring
  --ndb-nodeid=#      Set nodeid for this node. Overrides node id specified in
                      --ndb-connectstring.
  --ndb-optimization-delay=# 
                      For optimize table, specifies the delay in milliseconds
                      for each batch of rows sent.
  --ndb-optimized-node-selection[=#] 
                      Select nodes for transactions in a more optimal way.
  --ndb-read-backup   Create tables with Read Backup flag set. Enables those
                      tables to be read from backup replicas as well as from
                      primary replicas. Delays commit acknowledge of write
                      transactions to accomplish this.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ndb-read-backup to disable.)
  --ndb-recv-thread-activation-threshold=# 
                      Activation threshold when receive thread takes over the
                      polling of the cluster connection (measured in
                      concurrently active threads)
  --ndb-recv-thread-cpu-mask=name 
                      CPU mask for locking receiver threads to specific CPU,
                      specified  as hexadecimal as e.g. 0x33, one CPU is used
                      per receiver thread.
  --ndb-replica-batch-size[=#] 
                      Batch size in bytes for the replica applier.
  --ndb-replica-blob-write-batch-bytes[=#] 
                      Specifies the byte size of batched blob writes for the
                      replica applier. 0 == No limit.
  --ndb-report-thresh-binlog-epoch-slip=# 
                      Threshold for Binlog injector thread consumption lag,
                      before reporting the Event buffer status' message with
                      reason BUFFERED_EPOCHS_OVER_THRESHOLD. The lag is defined
                      as the number of epochs completely buffered in the event
                      buffer, but not consumed by the Binlog injector thread
                      yet.
  --ndb-report-thresh-binlog-mem-usage=# 
                      Threshold on percentage of free memory before reporting
                      binlog status. E.g. 10 means that if amount of available
                      memory for receiving binlog data from the storage nodes
                      goes below 10%, a status message will be sent to the
                      cluster log.
  --ndb-row-checksum[=#] 
                      Create tables with a row checksum, this checks for HW
                      issues at theexpense of performance
  --ndb-schema-dist-lock-wait-timeout=# 
                      Time (in seconds) during schema distribution to wait for
                      a lock before returning an error. This setting allows
                      avoiding that the binlog injector thread waits too long
                      while handling schema operations.
  --ndb-schema-dist-timeout[=#] 
                      Controls how many seconds it takes before timeout is
                      detected during schema distribution. Timeout might
                      indicate that activity on the other MySQL Server(s) are
                      high or are somehow prevented from acquiring the
                      necessary resources at this time.
  --ndb-schema-dist-upgrade-allowed 
                      Allow schema distribution table upgrade when connecting
                      to NDB. Use this variable to defer this change until all
                      MySQL Servers connected to the cluster have been upgrade
                      to same version. NOTE! The schema distribution
                      functionality might be slightly degraded until the change
                      has been performed.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ndb-schema-dist-upgrade-allowed to disable.)
  --ndb-show-foreign-key-mock-tables 
                      Show the mock tables which is used to support
                      foreign_key_checks= 0. Extra info warnings are shown when
                      creating and dropping the tables. The real table name is

                      plugin. Possible values are ON, OFF, FORCE (don't start
                      if the plugin fails to load).
  --ndb-use-copying-alter-table 
                      Force ndbcluster to always copy tables at alter table
                      (should only be used if online alter table fails).
  --ndb-use-exact-count 
                      Use exact records count during query planning and for
                      fast select count(*), disable for faster queries.
  --ndb-use-transactions 
                      Use transactions for large inserts, if enabled then large
                      inserts will be split into several smaller transactions
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ndb-use-transactions to disable.)

                      characters
  --no-dd-upgrade     Abort restart if automatic upgrade or downgrade of the
                      data dictionary is needed. Deprecated option. Use
                      --upgrade=NONE instead.
  --offline-mode      Make the server into offline mode
  --old               Use compatible behavior
  --old-alter-table   Use old, non-optimized alter table
  --old-style-user-limits 
                      Enable old-style user limits (before 5.0.3, user
                      resources were counted for each user + host vs. per
                      account). This option is deprecated and will be removed
                      in a future version.
  --open-files-limit=# 
                      If this is not 0, then mysqld will use this value to
                      reserve file descriptors to use with setrlimit(). If this
                      value is 0 then mysqld will reserve max_connections*5 or
                      max_connections + table_open_cache*2 (whichever is
                      larger) number of file descriptors
  --optimizer-max-subgraph-pairs=# 
                      Maximum depth of subgraph pairs a query can have before
                      the hypergraph join optimizer starts reducing the search
                      space heuristically. Larger values may result in better
                      query plans for large queries, but also more time and
                      memory spent during planning. Increasing this larger than
                      the actual number of subgraph pairs in the query will
                      have no further effect. Ignored by the old
                      (non-hypergraph) join optimizer
  --optimizer-prune-level=# 
                      Controls the heuristic(s) applied during query
                      optimization to prune less-promising partial plans from
                      the optimizer search space. Meaning: 0 - do not apply any
                      heuristic, thus perform exhaustive search; 1 - prune
                      plans based on number of retrieved rows
  --optimizer-search-depth=# 
                      Maximum depth of search performed by the query optimizer.
                      Values larger than the number of relations in a query
                      result in better query plans, but take longer to compile
                      a query. Values smaller than the number of tables in a
                      relation result in faster optimization, but may produce
                      very bad query plans. If set to 0, the system will
                      automatically pick a reasonable value

                      --compression-algorithms flag to specify a set of
                      algorithms, and the connection will use an algorithm
                      supported by both client and server. It picks zlib if
                      both client and server support it; otherwise it picks
                      zstd if both support it; otherwise it picks uncompressed
                      if both support it; otherwise it fails.

                      Maximum amount of memory used by the range optimizer to
                      allocate predicates during range analysis. The larger the
                      number, more memory may be consumed during range
                      analysis. If the value is too low to completed range
                      optimization of a query, index range scan will not be
                      considered for this query. A value of 0 means range
                      optimizer does not have any cap on memory. 
  --read-buffer-size=# 
                      Each thread that does a sequential scan allocates a
                      buffer of this size for each table it scans. If you do
                      many sequential scans, you may want to increase this
                      value
  --read-only         Make all non-temporary tables read-only, with the

                      information and associated workers.
  --relay-log-purge   if disabled - do not purge relay logs. if enabled - purge
                      them as soon as they are no more needed
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-relay-log-purge to disable.)
  --relay-log-recovery 
                      If enabled, existing relay logs will be skipped by the
                      replication threads. The receiver will start a new relay
                      log and the applier will start reading from the beginning
                      of that file. The receiver's position relative to the
                      source will be reset to the applier's position relative
                      to the source; the receiver uses this in case
                      SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=0.

                      (replica_parallel_workers>0), it will update the worker
                      progress status periodically. This option specifies the
                      maximum number of committed transactions between updates.
  --replica-checkpoint-period=# 
                      When using a multi-threaded applier
                      (replica_parallel_workers>0), it will update the worker
                      progress status periodically. This option specifies the
                      maximum number of milliseconds between updates.
  --replica-compressed-protocol 
                      Use compression in the source/replica protocol.
  --replica-exec-mode=name 
                      Modes for how replication events should be executed.
                      Legal values are STRICT (default) and IDEMPOTENT. In
                      IDEMPOTENT mode, replication will ignore duplicate key
                      errors and key not found errors. In STRICT mode,
                      replication will stop at those errors.
  --replica-load-tmpdir=name 
                      The location where this replica will store temporary
                      files when replicating a LOAD DATA INFILE command from a
                      source having binlog_format=STATEMENT.
  --replica-max-allowed-packet=#

                      Number of seconds to wait for more data from a
                      replication connection before aborting the read.
  --replica-parallel-type=name 
                      The method used by the replication applier to parallelize
                      transactions. DATABASE, indicates that it may apply
                      transactions in parallel in case they update different
                      databases. LOGICAL_CLOCK, which is the default, indicates
                      that it decides whether two transactions can be applied
                      in parallel using the logical timestamps computed by the
                      source, according to
                      binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking.
  --replica-parallel-workers=#

                      events that have not yet been applied. The queue size may
                      exceed this limit in case a single event is bigger than
                      the limit.
  --replica-preserve-commit-order 
                      Force replication worker threads to commit in the same
                      order as on the source. Enabled by default
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-replica-preserve-commit-order to disable.)
  --replica-skip-errors=name 
                      Comma-separated list of error numbers. If an applier
                      thread on this replica encounters one of these errors
                      while applying a Query_log_event, it will ignore the
                      error, rather than stop.
  --replica-sql-verify-checksum 
                      Force checksum verification of replication events after
                      reading them from relay log. Note: The replica always
                      verifies checksums for events received from the network,
                      if the event has a checksum at all, before it writes the
                      event to the relay log. Enabled by default.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-replica-sql-verify-checksum to disable.)
  --replica-transaction-retries=# 
                      Number of times the replication applier will retry a
                      transaction in case it failed with a deadlock or other
                      transient error, before it gives up and stops.
  --replica-type-conversions=name 
                      Set of type conversions that may be used by the
                      replication applier thread for row events. Allowed values
                      are: ALL_LOSSY to enable lossy conversions, ALL_NON_LOSSY
                      to enable non-lossy conversions, ALL_UNSIGNED to treat
                      all integer column type data to be unsigned values, and
                      ALL_SIGNED to treat all integer column type data to be
                      signed values. Default treatment is ALL_SIGNED. If
                      ALL_SIGNED and ALL_UNSIGNED both are specified,
                      ALL_SIGNED will take higher priority than ALL_UNSIGNED.
                      If the variable is assigned the empty set, no conversions
                      are allowed and it is expected that the types match
                      exactly.
  --replicate-do-db=name 
                      Make replication applier threads apply only changes to
                      the specified database. To specify more than one
                      database, use the directive multiple times, once for each
                      database. Note that this will only work if you do not use
                      cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
                      SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
                      database. If you need cross database updates to work,
                      make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
  --replicate-do-table=name 
                      Make replication applier threads apply only changes to
                      the specified table. To specify more than one table, use
                      the directive multiple times, once for each table. This
                      will work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-do-db.
  --replicate-ignore-db=name 
                      Make replication applier threads skip changes to the
                      specified database. To specify more than one database to
                      ignore, use this option multiple times, once for each
                      database. If there are statements that update multiple
                      databases, this will work correctly only when the source
                      server uses binlog_format=ROW.
  --replicate-ignore-table=name 
                      Make replication applier threads skip changes to the
                      specified table.To ignore more than one table, use the
                      option multiple times, once for each table. If there are
                      statements that update multiple tables, this will work
                      correctly only when the source server uses
                      binlog_format=ROW.
  --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
                      Make replication applier threads rename a database, so
                      changes in one database on the source will be applied in
                      another database on this replica. Example:
                      replicate-rewrite-db=source_db_name->replica_db_name.
  --replicate-same-server-id 
                      In replication, if set to 1, do not skip events having
                      our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
                      loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
                      --log-replica-updates is used.
  --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
                      Make replication applier threads apply changes only in
                      tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
                      specify more than one pattern, use the option multiple
                      times, once for each pattern. If there are statements
                      that update both tables that are included and excluded by
                      the pattern, this will only work correctly when the
                      source server uses binlog_format=ROW. Example:
                      replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
                      updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
                      and whose table names start with bar.
  --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
                      Make replication applier threads skip changes to tables
                      that match the specified wildcard pattern. To specify
                      more than one pattern, use the option multiple times,
                      once for each pattern. If there are statements that
                      update both tables that are included and tables that are
                      excluded by the pattern, this will only work correctly
                      when the source server uses binlog_format=ROW. Example:
                      when using replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar%, the
                      applier thread will not apply updates to tables in
                      databases that start with foo and whose table names start
                      with bar.
  --replication-optimize-for-static-plugin-config 
                      Optional flag that blocks plugin install/uninstall and
                      allows skipping the acquisition of the lock to read from
                      the plugin list and the usage of read-optimized
                      spin-locks. Use only when plugin hook callback needs
                      optimization (a lot of semi-sync replicas, for instance).
  --replication-sender-observe-commit-only 
                      Optional flag that allows for only calling back observer
                      hooks at commit.
  --report-host=name  Hostname or IP that this replica will report to the
                      source while initiating the replication connection. Will
                      appear in the output of SHOW REPLICAS. Leave this unset
                      if you do not want the replica to register itself with
                      the source. Note that it is not sufficient for the source
                      to simply read the IP of the replica off the socket once
                      the replica connects: in the presence of NAT other
                      routing features, that IP may not be valid for connecting
                      to the replica from the source or other hosts.
  --report-password=name 
                      The account password that this replica will report to the
                      source while initiating the replication connection.
  --report-port=#     The port for connecting to the replica, which this
                      replica will report to the source while initiating the
                      replication connection. Set it only if the replica is
                      listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
                      tunnel from the source or other clients to this replica.
                      If not sure, leave this option unset.
  --report-user=name  The account user name that this replica will report to
                      the source while initiating the replication connection.
  --require-secure-transport 
                      When this option is enabled, connections attempted using
                      insecure transport will be rejected.  Secure transports
                      are SSL/TLS, Unix socket or Shared Memory (on Windows).
  --rpl-read-size=#   The size for reads done from the binlog and relay log. It
                      must be a multiple of 4kb. Making it larger might help
                      with IO stalls while reading these files when they are
                      not in the OS buffer cache
  --rpl-stop-replica-timeout=# 
                      Timeout in seconds to wait for replication threads to
                      stop, before STOP REPLICA returns a warning.
  --rpl-stop-slave-timeout=# 
                      This option is deprecated. Use rpl_stop_replica_timeout
                      instead.
  --safe-user-create  Don't allow new user creation by the user who has no
                      write privileges to the mysql.user table.
  --schema-definition-cache=# 
                      The number of cached schema definitions
  --secondary-engine-cost-threshold[=#] 
                      Controls which statements to consider for execution in a
                      secondary storage engine. Only statements that have a
                      cost estimate higher than this value will be attempted
                      executed in a secondary storage engine.
  --secure-file-priv=name 
                      Limit LOAD DATA, SELECT ... OUTFILE, and LOAD_FILE() to
                      files within specified directory
  --select-into-buffer-size[=#]

                      SELECT INTO OUTFILE/DUMPFILE. Requires
                      select_into_sync_disk = ON.
  --server-id=#       Uniquely identifies the server instance in the community
                      of replication partners

  --session-track-gtids=name 
                      Controls the amount of global transaction ids to be
                      included in the response packet sent by the
                      server.(Default: OFF).
  --session-track-schema 
                      Track changes to the 'default schema'.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-session-track-schema to disable.)
  --session-track-state-change 
                      Track changes to the 'session state'.
  --session-track-system-variables=name

                      disable; STATE to track just transaction state (Is there
                      an active transaction? Does it have any data? etc.);
                      CHARACTERISTICS to track transaction state and report all
                      statements needed to start a transaction with the same
                      characteristics (isolation level, read only/read write,
                      snapshot - but not any work done / data modified within
                      the transaction).
  --sha256-password-auto-generate-rsa-keys 
                      Auto generate RSA keys at server startup if corresponding
                      system variables are not specified and key files are not
                      present at the default location.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-sha256-password-auto-generate-rsa-keys to disable.)
  --sha256-password-private-key-path=name 
                      A fully qualified path to the private RSA key used for
                      authentication
  --sha256-password-proxy-users 
                      If set to FALSE (the default), then the sha256_password
                      authentication plugin will not signal for authenticated
                      users to be checked for mapping to proxy users.  When set
                      to TRUE, the plugin will flag associated authenticated
                      accounts to be mapped to proxy users when the server
                      option check_proxy_users is enabled.
  --sha256-password-public-key-path=name 
                      A fully qualified path to the public RSA key used for
                      authentication
  --show-create-table-verbosity 
                      When this option is enabled, it increases the verbosity
                      of 'SHOW CREATE TABLE'.
  --show-gipk-in-create-table-and-information-schema 
                      When set, if a primary key is generated for a table then
                      SHOW commands and INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables shows
                      generated invisible primary key definition.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-show-gipk-in-create-table-and-information-schema to disable.)
  --show-old-temporals 
                      When this option is enabled, the pre-5.6.4 temporal types

  --skip-new          Don't use new, possibly wrong routines.
  --skip-replica-start 
                      Do not start replication threads automatically when the
                      server starts.
  --skip-show-database 
                      Don't allow 'SHOW DATABASE' commands
  --skip-slave-start  This option is deprecated. Use skip_replica_start
                      instead.
  --skip-stack-trace  Don't print a stack trace on failure.
  --slave-allow-batching 
                      This option is deprecated. Use replica_allow_batching
                      instead.

                      This option is deprecated. Use replica_checkpoint_period
                      instead.
  --slave-compressed-protocol 
                      This option is deprecated. Use
                      replica_compressed_protocol instead.

                      replica_preserve_commit_order instead.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-slave-preserve-commit-order to disable.)
  --slave-rows-search-algorithms=name 
                      The set of algorithms used by the replication applier
                      while searching the table for rows to update or delete.
                      Possible values are: INDEX_SCAN, TABLE_SCAN and
                      HASH_SCAN. Any combination is allowed, and the applier
                      picks the most efficient among them for any given
                      scenario. (Default: INDEX_SCAN, HASH_SCAN).
  --slave-skip-errors=name 
                      This option is deprecated. Use replica_skip_errors
                      instead.
  --slave-sql-verify-checksum 
                      This option is deprecated. Use
                      replica_sql_verify_checksum instead.

  --slave-transaction-retries=# 
                      This option is deprecated. Use
                      replica_transaction_retries instead.

                      This option is deprecated. Use replica_type_conversions
                      instead.
  --slow-launch-time=# 
                      If creating the thread takes longer than this value (in
                      seconds), the Slow_launch_threads counter will be
                      incremented
  --slow-query-log    Log slow queries to a table or log file. Defaults logging
                      to a file hostname-slow.log or a table mysql.slow_log if

                      replication.
  --sql-generate-invisible-primary-key 
                      When set, if a table is created without a primary key
                      then server generates invisible auto-increment column as
                      a primary key for the table.
  --sql-mode=name     Syntax: sql-mode=mode[,mode[,mode...]]. See the manual
                      for the complete list of valid sql modes
  --sql-require-primary-key 
                      When set, tables must be created with a primary key, and
                      an existing primary key cannot be removed with 'ALTER

                      SSL FIPS mode (applies only for OpenSSL); permitted
                      values are: OFF, ON, STRICT
  --ssl-key=name      X509 key in PEM format (implies --ssl)
  --ssl-session-cache-mode 
                      Is TLS session cache enabled or not

                      the SUPER privilege are affected, unlike read_only. 
                      Setting super_read_only to ON also sets read_only to ON.
  -s, --symbolic-links 
                      Enable symbolic link support (deprecated and will be 
                      removed in a future release).

                      periodically, after the specified number of events. Use 0
                      to disable periodic synchronization.
  --sysdate-is-now    Non-default option to alias SYSDATE() to NOW() to make it
                      safe-replicable. Since 5.0, SYSDATE() returns a `dynamic'
                      value different for different invocations, even within
                      the same statement.
  --table-definition-cache=# 
                      The number of cached table definitions
  --table-encryption-privilege-check 
                      Indicates if server enables privilege check when user
                      tries to use non-default value for CREATE DATABASE or
                      CREATE TABLESPACE or when user tries to do CREATE TABLE
                      with ENCRYPTION option which deviates from per-database

                      cache instances)
  --table-open-cache-instances=# 
                      The number of table cache instances

                      engine is allowed to allocate from MMAP-backed files
                      before starting to store data on disk.
  --temptable-max-ram=# 
                      Maximum amount of memory (in bytes) the TempTable storage
                      engine is allowed to allocate from the main memory (RAM)
                      before starting to store data on disk.
  --temptable-use-mmap 
                      Use mmap files for temptables. This variable is
                      deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-temptable-use-mmap to disable.)
  --terminology-use-previous=name 
                      Make monitoring tables and statements use the identifiers
                      that were in use before they were changed in a given
                      release. That includes names for mutexes, read/write
                      locks, condition variables, memory allocations, thread
                      names, thread stages, and thread commands. When the
                      session option is set to BEFORE_8_0_26, the session uses
                      the names that were in use until 8.0.25, when it selects
                      from performance_schema tables, or selects from
                      INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST, or issues SHOW
                      PROCESSLIST or SHOW REPLICA STATUS. When the global
                      option is set to BEFORE_8_0_26, new sessions use
                      BEFORE_8_0_26 as default for the session option, and in
                      addition the thread commands that were in use until
                      8.0.25 are written to the slow query log.
  --thread-cache-size=# 
                      How many threads we should keep in a cache for reuse
  --thread-handling=name 
                      Define threads usage for handling queries, one of
                      one-thread-per-connection, no-threads, loaded-dynamically
  --thread-stack=#    The stack size for each thread

  --tls-version=name  TLS version, permitted values are TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3
  --tmp-table-size=#  If an internal in-memory temporary table in the MEMORY or
                      TempTable storage engine exceeds this size, MySQL will
                      automatically convert it to an on-disk table 
  -t, --tmpdir=name   Path for temporary files. Several paths may be specified,
                      separated by a colon (:), in this case they are used in a
                      round-robin fashion
  --transaction-alloc-block-size=# 
                      Allocation block size for transactions to be stored in

                      Persistent buffer for transactions to be stored in binary
                      log
  --transaction-read-only 
                      Default transaction access mode. True if transactions are
                      read-only.
  --transaction-write-set-extraction[=name] 
                      This option is used to let the server know when to
                      extract the write set which will be used for various
                      purposes. 
  --updatable-views-with-limit=name 
                      YES = Don't issue an error message (warning only) if a
                      VIEW without presence of a key of the underlying table is
                      used in queries with a LIMIT clause for updating. NO =
                      Prohibit update of a VIEW, which does not contain a key
                      of the underlying table and the query uses a LIMIT clause
                      (usually get from GUI tools)
  --upgrade=name      Set server upgrade mode. NONE to abort server if
                      automatic upgrade of the server is needed; MINIMAL to
                      start the server, but skip upgrade steps that are not
                      absolutely necessary; AUTO (default) to upgrade the
                      server if required; FORCE to force upgrade server.
  -u, --user=name     Run mysqld daemon as user.
  --validate-config   Validate the server configuration specified by the user.
  --validate-user-plugins 
                      Turns on additional validation of authentication plugins
                      assigned to user accounts. 
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-validate-user-plugins to disable.)
  -v, --verbose       Used with --help option for detailed help.
  -V, --version       Output version information and exit.
  --wait-timeout=#    The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a
                      connection before closing it
  --windowing-use-high-precision 
                      For SQL window functions, determines whether to enable
                      inversion optimization for moving window frames also for
                      floating values.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-windowing-use-high-precision to disable.)
  --xa-detach-on-prepare 
                      When set, XA transactions will be detached (AKA
                      dissociated or disconnected) from connection as part of
                      XA PREPARE. This means that the XA transaction can be
                      committed/rolled back by any connection, even if the
                      starting connection has not terminated, and the starting
                      connection can start new transactions. As a side effect,
                      temporary tables cannot be used inside XA transactions.
                      When disabled, XA transactions are associated with the
                      same connection until the session disconnects. ON is the
                      only safe choice for replication.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-xa-detach-on-prepare to disable.)

Starts the MySQL database server.

Usage: mysqld [OPTIONS]

Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
/etc/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf /usr/etc/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf 
The following groups are read: mysql_cluster mysqld server mysqld-8.0
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults        Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults           Don't read default options from any option file,
                        except for login file.
--defaults-file=#       Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=#
                        Also read groups with concat(group, suffix)
--login-path=#          Read this path from the login file.

  --abort-slave-event-count=# 
                      Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
                      replication.This option is deprecated and will be removed
                      in a future version. 
  --activate-all-roles-on-login 
                      Automatically set all granted roles as active after the
                      user has authenticated successfully.
  --admin-address=name 
                      IP address to bind to for service connection. Address can
                      be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or host name. Wildcard
                      values *, ::, 0.0.0.0 are not allowed. Address value can
                      have following optional network namespace separated by
                      the delimiter / from the address value. E.g., the
                      following value 192.168.1.1/red specifies IP addresses to
                      listen for incoming TCP connections that have to be
                      placed into the namespace 'red'. Using of network
                      namespace requires its support from underlying Operating
                      System. Attempt to specify a network namespace for a
                      platform that doesn't support it results in error during
                      socket creation.
  --admin-port=#      Port number to use for service connection, built-in
                      default (33062)
  --admin-ssl         Enable SSL for admin interface (automatically enabled
                      with other flags).
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-admin-ssl to disable.)
  --admin-ssl-ca=name CA file in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl)
                      for --admin-port
  --admin-ssl-capath=name 
                      CA directory (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl) for
                      --admin-port
  --admin-ssl-cert=name 
                      X509 cert in PEM format (implies --ssl) for --admin-port
  --admin-ssl-cipher=name 
                      SSL cipher to use (implies --ssl) for --admin-port
  --admin-ssl-crl=name 
                      CRL file in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies
                      --ssl) for --admin-port
  --admin-ssl-crlpath=name 
                      CRL directory (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl) for
                      --admin-port
  --admin-ssl-key=name 
                      X509 key in PEM format (implies --ssl) for --admin-port
  --admin-tls-ciphersuites=name 
                      TLS v1.3 ciphersuite to use (implies --ssl) for
                      --admin-port
  --admin-tls-version=name 
                      TLS version for --admin-port, permitted values are
                      TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3
  --allow-suspicious-udfs 
                      Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
                      without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
                      also means that one can load any function from any
                      library, for example exit() from libc.so
  -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
                      will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
  --archive[=name]    Enable or disable ARCHIVE plugin. Possible values are ON,
                      OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --authentication-policy=name 
                      Defines policies around how user account can be
                      configured with Multi Factor authentication methods
                      during CREATE/ALTER USER statement. This variable accepts
                      at-most 3 comma separated list of authentication plugin
                      names where each value refers to what authentication
                      plugin should be used in place of 1st Factor
                      Authentication (FA), 2FA and 3FA method. Value *
                      indicates any plugin is allowed for 1FA, 2FA and 3FA
                      method. An empty value means nth FA method is optional.
  --auto-generate-certs 
                      Auto generate SSL certificates at server startup if --ssl
                      is set to ON and none of the other SSL system variables
                      are specified and certificate/key files are not present
                      in data directory.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-auto-generate-certs to disable.)
  --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
                      Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
  --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
                      Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
                      auto-increment-increment != 1
  --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
  --automatic-sp-privileges 
                      Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
  --avoid-temporal-upgrade 
                      When this option is enabled, the pre-5.6.4 temporal types
                      are not upgraded to the new format for ALTER TABLE
                      requests ADD/CHANGE/MODIFY COLUMN, ADD INDEX or FORCE
                      operation. This variable is deprecated and will be
                      removed in a future release.
  --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can
                      have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
                      gets very many connection requests in a very short time
  -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
                      resolved relative to this
  --big-tables        Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on
                      file (Solves most 'table full' errors)
  --bind-address=name IP address(es) to bind to. Syntax: address[,address]...,
                      where address can be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, host
                      name or one of the wildcard values *, ::, 0.0.0.0. In
                      case more than one address is specified in a
                      comma-separated list, wildcard values are not allowed.
                      Every address can have optional network namespace
                      separated by the delimiter / from the address value.
                      E.g., the following value
                      192.168.1.1/red,172.16.1.1/green,193.168.1.1 specifies
                      three IP addresses to listen for incoming TCP connections
                      two of that have to be placed in corresponding
                      namespaces: the address 192.168.1.1 must be placed into
                      the namespace red and the address 172.16.1.1 must be
                      placed into the namespace green. Using of network
                      namespace requires its support from underlying Operating
                      System. Attempt to specify a network namespace for a
                      platform that doesn't support it results in error during
                      socket creation.
  --binlog-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the transactional cache for updates to
                      transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
                      use transactions containing many statements, you can
                      increase this to get more performance
  --binlog-checksum=name 
                      Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
                      events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
                      CRC32; default is CRC32.
  --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
                      Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
                      statement format to be written directly to binary log,
                      after executing them and before committing the
                      transaction. Before using this option make sure that
                      there are no dependencies between transactional and
                      non-transactional tables such as in the statement INSERT
                      INTO t_myisam SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, replicas
                      may diverge.
  --binlog-do-db=name Include only updates to the specified database when
                      writing the binary log.
  --binlog-encryption Enable/disable binary and relay logs encryption.
  --binlog-error-action=name 
                      When statements cannot be written to the binary log due
                      to a fatal error, this option determines whether the
                      server ignores the error and closes the binary log, or
                      aborts.
  --binlog-expire-logs-auto-purge 
                      Controls whether the server shall automatically purge
                      binary log files or not. If this variable is set to FALSE
                      then the server will not purge binary log files
                      automatically.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-expire-logs-auto-purge to disable.)
  --binlog-expire-logs-seconds=# 
                      If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
                      binlog_expire_logs_seconds seconds; If both this option
                      and expire_logs_days are set to non-zero  values, this
                      option takes priority. Purges happen at startup and at
                      binary log rotation.
  --binlog-format=name 
                      The format used when writing the binary log. ROW writes
                      each changed row in a binary format. STATEMENT writes SQL
                      statements. MIXED writes SQL statements for most
                      statements, and row format for statements that cannot be
                      replayed in a deterministic manner using SQL. If
                      NDBCLUSTER is enabled and binlog-format is MIXED, the
                      format switches to row-based and back implicitly for each
                      query accessing an NDBCLUSTER table.
  --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay=# 
                      The number of microseconds the server waits for the
                      binary log group commit sync queue to fill before
                      continuing. Default: 0. Min: 0. Max: 1000000.
  --binlog-group-commit-sync-no-delay-count=# 
                      If there are this many transactions in the commit sync
                      queue and the server is waiting for more transactions to
                      be enqueued (as set using
                      --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay), the commit procedure
                      resumes.
  --binlog-gtid-simple-recovery 
                      If this option is enabled, the server does not open more
                      than two binary logs when initializing GTID_PURGED and
                      GTID_EXECUTED, either during server restart or when
                      binary logs are being purged. Enabling this option is
                      useful when the server has already generated many binary
                      logs without GTID events (e.g., having GTID_MODE = OFF).
                      Note: If this option is enabled, GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED and
                      GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED may be initialized wrongly in two
                      cases: (1) All binary logs were generated by MySQL 5.7.5
                      or older, and GTID_MODE was ON for some binary logs but
                      OFF for the newest binary log. (2) The oldest existing
                      binary log was generated by MySQL 5.7.5 or older, and SET
                      GTID_PURGED was issued after the oldest binary log was
                      generated. If a wrong set is computed in one of case (1)
                      or case (2), it will remain wrong even if the server is
                      later restarted with this option disabled.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-gtid-simple-recovery to disable.)
  --binlog-ignore-db=name 
                      Exclude updates to the specified database when writing
                      the binary log.
  --binlog-max-flush-queue-time=# 
                      The maximum time that the binary log group commit will
                      keep reading transactions before it flush the
                      transactions to the binary log (and optionally sync,
                      depending on the value of sync_binlog).
  --binlog-order-commits 
                      Issue internal commit calls in the same order as
                      transactions are written to the binary log. Default is to
                      order commits.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-order-commits to disable.)
  --binlog-rotate-encryption-master-key-at-startup 
                      Force binlog encryption master key rotation at startup
  --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
                      The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
                      bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
                      size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
  --binlog-row-image=name 
                      Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
                      'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
                      columns in the before and after image are logged.
                      'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
                      whenever possible (e.g. blob column was not changed or is
                      not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
                      equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
                      the table) is logged in the before image, and only
                      changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
                      FULL).
  --binlog-row-metadata=name 
                      Controls how much type information is written to the
                      binary log when using ROW format. FULL causes all
                      metadata to be logged. MINIMAL means that only metadata
                      actually needed by replicas is logged.
  --binlog-row-value-options=name 
                      When set to PARTIAL_JSON, this option enables a
                      space-efficient row-based binary log format for UPDATE
                      statements that modify a JSON value using only the
                      functions JSON_SET, JSON_REPLACE, and JSON_REMOVE. For
                      such updates, only the modified parts of the JSON
                      document are included in the binary log, so small changes
                      of big documents may need significantly less space.
  --binlog-rows-query-log-events 
                      Allow writing of Rows_query_log events into binary log.
  --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the statement cache for updates to
                      non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
                      often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
                      can increase this to get more performance
  --binlog-transaction-compression 
                      Whether to compress transactions or not. Transactions are
                      compressed using the ZSTD compression algorythm.
  --binlog-transaction-compression-level-zstd=# 
                      Specifies the transaction compression level for ZSTD
                      transaction compression in the binary log.
  --binlog-transaction-dependency-history-size=# 
                      Maximum number of rows to keep in the writeset history.
  --binlog-transaction-dependency-tracking=name 
                      Selects the source of dependency information from which
                      to compute logical timestamps, which replicas can use to
                      decide which transactions can be executed in parallel
                      when using replica_parallel_type=LOGICAL_CLOCK. Possible
                      values are COMMIT_ORDER, WRITESET and WRITESET_SESSION.
  --blackhole[=name]  Enable or disable BLACKHOLE plugin. Possible values are
                      ON, OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --block-encryption-mode=name 
                      mode for AES_ENCRYPT/AES_DECRYPT
  --bulk-insert-buffer-size=# 
                      Size of tree cache used in bulk insert optimisation. Note
                      that this is a limit per thread!
  --caching-sha2-password-auto-generate-rsa-keys 
                      Auto generate RSA keys at server startup if corresponding
                      system variables are not specified and key files are not
                      present at the default location.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-caching-sha2-password-auto-generate-rsa-keys to disable.)
  --caching-sha2-password-digest-rounds=# 
                      Number of SHA2 rounds to be done when storing a password
                      hash onto disk.
  --caching-sha2-password-private-key-path=name 
                      A fully qualified path to the private RSA key used for
                      authentication.
  --caching-sha2-password-public-key-path=name 
                      A fully qualified path to the public RSA key used for
                      authentication.
  --character-set-client-handshake 
                      Don't ignore client side character set value sent during
                      handshake.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-character-set-client-handshake to disable.)
  --character-set-filesystem=name 
                      Set the filesystem character set.
  -C, --character-set-server=name 
                      Set the default character set.
  --character-sets-dir=name 
                      Directory where character sets are
  --check-proxy-users If set to FALSE (the default), then proxy user identity
                      will not be mapped for authentication plugins which
                      support mapping from grant tables.  When set to TRUE,
                      users associated with authentication plugins which signal
                      proxy user mapping should be done according to GRANT
                      PROXY privilege definition.
  -r, --chroot=name   Chroot mysqld daemon during startup.
  --collation-server=name 
                      Set the default collation.
  --completion-type=name 
                      The transaction completion type, one of NO_CHAIN, CHAIN,
                      RELEASE
  --concurrent-insert[=name] 
                      Use concurrent insert with MyISAM. Possible values are
                      NEVER, AUTO, ALWAYS
  --connect-timeout=# The number of seconds the mysqld server is waiting for a
                      connect packet before responding with 'Bad handshake'
  --connection-memory-chunk-size=# 
                      Chunk size regulating frequency of updating the global
                      memory counter
  --connection-memory-limit=# 
                      Maximum amount of memory connection can consume
  --console           Write error output on screen; don't remove the console
                      window on windows.
  --core-file         Write core on errors.
  --create-admin-listener-thread 
                      Use a dedicated thread for listening incoming connections
                      on admin interface
  --cte-max-recursion-depth=# 
                      Abort a recursive common table expression if it does more
                      than this number of iterations.
  -D, --daemonize     Run mysqld as sysv daemon
  -h, --datadir=name  Path to the database root directory
  --default-authentication-plugin=name 
                      The default authentication plugin used by the server to
                      hash the password.
  --default-password-lifetime=# 
                      The number of days after which the password will expire.
  --default-storage-engine=name 
                      The default storage engine for new tables
  --default-table-encryption 
                      Database and tablespace are created with this default
                      encryption property unless the user specifies an explicit
                      encryption property.
  --default-time-zone=name 
                      Set the default time zone.
  --default-tmp-storage-engine=name 
                      The default storage engine for new explicit temporary
                      tables
  --default-week-format=# 
                      The default week format used by WEEK() functions
  --delay-key-write[=name] 
                      Type of DELAY_KEY_WRITE
  --delayed-insert-limit=# 
                      After inserting delayed_insert_limit rows, the INSERT
                      DELAYED handler will check if there are any SELECT
                      statements pending. If so, it allows these to execute
                      before continuing. This variable is deprecated along with
                      INSERT DELAYED.
  --delayed-insert-timeout=# 
                      How long a INSERT DELAYED thread should wait for INSERT
                      statements before terminating. This variable is
                      deprecated along with INSERT DELAYED.
  --delayed-queue-size=# 
                      What size queue (in rows) should be allocated for
                      handling INSERT DELAYED. If the queue becomes full, any
                      client that does INSERT DELAYED will wait until there is
                      room in the queue again. This variable is deprecated
                      along with INSERT DELAYED.
  --disabled-storage-engines=name 
                      Limit CREATE TABLE for the storage engines listed
  --disconnect-on-expired-password 
                      Give clients that don't signal password expiration
                      support execution time error(s) instead of connection
                      error
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-disconnect-on-expired-password to disable.)
  --disconnect-slave-event-count=# 
                      Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
                      replication.This option is deprecated and will be removed
                      in a future version.
  --div-precision-increment=# 
                      Precision of the result of '/' operator will be increased
                      on that value
  --early-plugin-load=name 
                      Optional semicolon-separated list of plugins to load
                      before storage engine initialization, where each plugin
                      is identified as name=library, where name is the plugin
                      name and library is the plugin library in plugin_dir.
  --end-markers-in-json 
                      In JSON output ("EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON" and optimizer
                      trace), if variable is set to 1, repeats the structure's
                      key (if it has one) near the closing bracket
  --enforce-gtid-consistency[=name] 
                      Prevents execution of statements that would be impossible
                      to log in a transactionally safe manner. Currently, the
                      disallowed statements include CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
                      inside transactions, all updates to non-transactional
                      tables, and CREATE TABLE ... SELECT.
  --eq-range-index-dive-limit=# 
                      The optimizer will use existing index statistics instead
                      of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of
                      equality ranges for the index is larger than or equal to
                      this number. If set to 0, index dives are always used.
  --event-scheduler[=name] 
                      Enable the event scheduler. Possible values are ON, OFF,
                      and DISABLED (keep the event scheduler completely
                      deactivated, it cannot be activated run-time)
  -T, --exit-info[=#] Used for debugging. Use at your own risk.
  --expire-logs-days=# 
                      If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
                      expire_logs_days days; If this option alone is set on the
                      command line or in a configuration file, it overrides the
                      default value for binlog-expire-logs-seconds. If both
                      options are set to nonzero values,
                      binlog-expire-logs-seconds takes priority. Possible
                      purges happen at startup and at binary log rotation.
  --explain-format[=name] 
                      The default format in which the EXPLAIN statement
                      displays information. Valid values are TRADITIONAL
                      (default), TREE, JSON and TRADITIONAL_STRICT.
                      TRADITIONAL_STRICT is only used internally by the mtr
                      test suite, and is not meant to be used anywhere else.
  --explicit-defaults-for-timestamp 
                      This option causes CREATE TABLE to create all TIMESTAMP
                      columns as NULL with DEFAULT NULL attribute, Without this
                      option, TIMESTAMP columns are NOT NULL and have implicit
                      DEFAULT clauses. The old behavior is deprecated. The
                      variable can only be set by users having the SUPER
                      privilege.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-explicit-defaults-for-timestamp to disable.)

                      EVENTUAL, BEFORE_ON_PRIMARY_FAILOVER, BEFORE, AFTER,
                      BEFORE_AND_AFTER
  --gtid-executed-compression-period[=#] 
                      Compress the mysql.gtid_executed table whenever this
                      number of transactions have been added, by waking up a
                      foreground thread (compress_gtid_table). This compression
                      method only operates when binary logging is disabled on
                      the replica; if binary logging is enabled, the table is
                      compressed every time the binary log is rotated, and this
                      value is ignored. Before MySQL 8.0.23, the default is
                      1000, and from MySQL 8.0.23, the default is zero, which
                      disables this compression method. This is because in
                      releases from MySQL 8.0.17, InnoDB transactions are
                      written to the mysql.gtid_executed table by a separate
                      process to non-InnoDB transactions. If the server has a
                      mix of InnoDB and non-InnoDB transactions, attempting to
                      compress the table with the compress_gtid_table thread
                      can slow this process, so from MySQL 8.0.17 it is
                      recommended that you set gtid_executed_compression_period
                      to 0.
  --gtid-mode=name    Controls whether Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs)
                      are enabled. Can be OFF, OFF_PERMISSIVE, ON_PERMISSIVE,
                      or ON. OFF means that no transaction has a GTID.
                      OFF_PERMISSIVE means that new transactions (committed in
                      a client session using GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC') are not
                      assigned any GTID, and replicated transactions are
                      allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON_PERMISSIVE means
                      that new transactions are assigned a GTID, and replicated
                      transactions are allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON
                      means that all transactions have a GTID. ON is required
                      on a source before any replica can use
                      SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1. To safely switch from OFF to ON,
                      first set all servers to OFF_PERMISSIVE, then set all
                      servers to ON_PERMISSIVE, then wait for all transactions
                      without a GTID to be replicated and executed on all
                      servers, and finally set all servers to GTID_MODE = ON.

                      Password to use when connecting to server during keyring
                      migration. If password value is not specified then it
                      will be asked from the tty.

                      Keyring plugin from where the keys needs to be migrated
                      to. This option must be specified along with
                      --keyring-migration-destination.

  -L, --language=name Client error messages in given language. May be given as
                      a full path. Deprecated. Use --lc-messages-dir instead.
  --large-pages       Enable support for large pages

                      Set the language used for the month names and the days of
                      the week.
  --local-infile      Enable LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
  --lock-wait-timeout=# 
                      Timeout in seconds to wait for a lock before returning an
                      error.
  --log-bin[=name]    Configures the name prefix to use for binary log files.
                      If the --log-bin option is not supplied, the name prefix
                      defaults to "binlog". If the --log-bin option is supplied
                      without argument, the name prefix defaults to
                      "HOSTNAME-bin", where HOSTNAME is the machine's hostname.
                      To set a different name prefix for binary log files, use
                      --log-bin=name. To disable binary logging, use the
                      --skip-log-bin or --disable-log-bin option.
  --log-bin-index=name 
                      File that holds the names for binary log files.
  --log-bin-trust-function-creators 
                      If set to FALSE (the default), then when --log-bin is
                      used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
                      allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
                      if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
                      logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
                      ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
                      do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
                      can safely set this to TRUE
  --log-bin-use-v1-row-events 
                      If equal to 1 then version 1 row events are written to a
                      row based binary log.  If equal to 0, then the latest
                      version of events are written.  This option is useful
                      during some upgrades.

  --log-error-suppression-list=name 
                      Comma-separated list of error-codes. Error messages
                      corresponding to these codes will not be included in the
                      error log. Only events with a severity of Warning or
                      Information can be suppressed; events with System or
                      Error severity will always be included. Requires the
                      filter 'log_filter_internal' to be set in
                      @@global.log_error_services, which is the default.

                      use in debugging, not production as sensitive information
                      may be logged.
  --log-replica-updates 
                      If enabled, the replication applier threads will write to
                      this server's binary log.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-log-replica-updates to disable.)
  --log-short-format  Don't log extra information to update and slow-query
                      logs.
  --log-slave-updates This option is deprecated. Use log_replica_updates
                      instead.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-log-slave-updates to disable.)
  --log-slow-admin-statements 
                      Log slow OPTIMIZE, ANALYZE, ALTER and other
                      administrative statements to the slow log if it is open.

                      Log slow statements executed by the replication applier
                      threads to the slow log if it is open.
  --log-slow-slave-statements 
                      This option is deprecated. Use
                      log_slow_replica_statements instead.
  --log-statements-unsafe-for-binlog

                      based binary logging.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-log-statements-unsafe-for-binlog to disable.)
  --log-tc=name       Path to transaction coordinator log (used for
                      transactions that affect more than one storage engine,

                      condensed into a single summary line. A value of 0
                      disables throttling. Option has no effect unless
                      --log_queries_not_using_indexes is set.
  --log-timestamps=name 
                      UTC to timestamp log files in zulu time, for more concise
                      timestamps and easier correlation of logs from servers
                      from multiple time zones, or SYSTEM to use the system's
                      local time. This affects only log files, not log tables,
                      as the timestamp columns of the latter can be converted
                      at will.
  --long-query-time=# Log all queries that have taken more than long_query_time
                      seconds to execute to file. The argument will be treated

                      to 2 if you are using a case insensitive file system
  --mandatory-roles=name 
                      All the specified roles are always considered granted to
                      every user and they can't be revoked. Mandatory roles
                      still require activation unless they are made into
                      default roles. The granted roles will not be visible in

                      and will be removed in a future version. Use 'CHANGE
                      REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_RETRY_COUNT = <num>'
                      instead.
  --master-verify-checksum

  --ndb-fully-replicated 
                      Create tables that are fully replicated by default. This
                      enables reading from any data node when using

                      Normally empty updates are filtered away before they are
                      logged. However, for read tracking in conflict resolution
                      a hidden pesudo attribute is set which will result in an
                      empty update along with special flags set. For this to
                      work empty updates have to be allowed.
  --ndb-log-exclusive-reads 
                      Log primary key reads with exclusive locks to allow
                      conflict resolution based on read conflicts

                      events is not possible
  --ndb-log-orig      Log originating server id and epoch in ndb_binlog_index.
                      Each epoch may in this case have multiple rows in
                      ndb_binlog_index, one for each originating epoch.

                      Log Ndb transaction identities per row in the Binlog
  --ndb-log-update-as-write 
                      For efficiency log only after image as a write event.
                      Ignore before image. This may cause compatibility
                      problems if replicating to other storage engines than
                      ndbcluster.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ndb-log-update-as-write to disable.)
  --ndb-log-update-minimal 
                      For efficiency, log updates in a minimal formatLog only
                      the primary key value(s) in the before image. Log only
                      the changed columns in the after image. This may cause
                      compatibility problems if replicating to other storage
                      engines than ndbcluster.
  --ndb-log-updated-only 
                      For efficiency log only updated columns. Columns are
                      considered as "updated" even if they are updated with the
                      same value. This may cause compatibility problems if
                      replicating to other storage engines than ndbcluster.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ndb-log-updated-only to disable.)

                      see if there are NDB metadata changes to be synchronized
  --ndb-metadata-sync Triggers immediate synchronization of all changes between
                      NDB Dictionary and MySQL server. Setting this option
                      results in the values of ndb_metadata_check and
                      ndb_metadata_check_interval being ignored. Automatically
                      resets to false when the synchronization has completed
  --ndb-mgmd-host=name 
                      Same as --ndb-connectstring
  --ndb-nodeid=#      Set nodeid for this node. Overrides node id specified in
                      --ndb-connectstring.

  --ndb-read-backup   Create tables with Read Backup flag set. Enables those
                      tables to be read from backup replicas as well as from
                      primary replicas. Delays commit acknowledge of write
                      transactions to accomplish this.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ndb-read-backup to disable.)
  --ndb-recv-thread-activation-threshold=# 
                      Activation threshold when receive thread takes over the
                      polling of the cluster connection (measured in
                      concurrently active threads)
  --ndb-recv-thread-cpu-mask=name 
                      CPU mask for locking receiver threads to specific CPU,
                      specified  as hexadecimal as e.g. 0x33, one CPU is used
                      per receiver thread.

                      before reporting the Event buffer status' message with
                      reason BUFFERED_EPOCHS_OVER_THRESHOLD. The lag is defined
                      as the number of epochs completely buffered in the event
                      buffer, but not consumed by the Binlog injector thread
                      yet.
  --ndb-report-thresh-binlog-mem-usage=# 
                      Threshold on percentage of free memory before reporting
                      binlog status. E.g. 10 means that if amount of available
                      memory for receiving binlog data from the storage nodes
                      goes below 10%, a status message will be sent to the
                      cluster log.

                      Time (in seconds) during schema distribution to wait for
                      a lock before returning an error. This setting allows
                      avoiding that the binlog injector thread waits too long
                      while handling schema operations.
  --ndb-schema-dist-timeout[=#] 
                      Controls how many seconds it takes before timeout is
                      detected during schema distribution. Timeout might
                      indicate that activity on the other MySQL Server(s) are
                      high or are somehow prevented from acquiring the
                      necessary resources at this time.
  --ndb-schema-dist-upgrade-allowed 
                      Allow schema distribution table upgrade when connecting
                      to NDB. Use this variable to defer this change until all
                      MySQL Servers connected to the cluster have been upgrade
                      to same version. NOTE! The schema distribution
                      functionality might be slightly degraded until the change
                      has been performed.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ndb-schema-dist-upgrade-allowed to disable.)

  --open-files-limit=# 
                      If this is not 0, then mysqld will use this value to
                      reserve file descriptors to use with setrlimit(). If this
                      value is 0 then mysqld will reserve max_connections*5 or
                      max_connections + table_open_cache*2 (whichever is
                      larger) number of file descriptors
  --optimizer-max-subgraph-pairs=# 
                      Maximum depth of subgraph pairs a query can have before
                      the hypergraph join optimizer starts reducing the search
                      space heuristically. Larger values may result in better
                      query plans for large queries, but also more time and
                      memory spent during planning. Increasing this larger than
                      the actual number of subgraph pairs in the query will
                      have no further effect. Ignored by the old
                      (non-hypergraph) join optimizer
  --optimizer-prune-level=# 
                      Controls the heuristic(s) applied during query
                      optimization to prune less-promising partial plans from
                      the optimizer search space. Meaning: 0 - do not apply any
                      heuristic, thus perform exhaustive search; 1 - prune
                      plans based on number of retrieved rows
  --optimizer-search-depth=# 
                      Maximum depth of search performed by the query optimizer.
                      Values larger than the number of relations in a query
                      result in better query plans, but take longer to compile
                      a query. Values smaller than the number of tables in a
                      relation result in faster optimization, but may produce
                      very bad query plans. If set to 0, the system will
                      automatically pick a reasonable value

                      SHOW CREATE USER will print the AS clause as HEX if it
                      contains non-prinable characters
  --profiling-history-size=# 
                      Limit of query profiling memory
  --protocol-compression-algorithms=name 
                      List of compression algorithms supported by server.
                      Supported values are any combination of zlib, zstd,
                      uncompressed. Command line clients may use the
                      --compression-algorithms flag to specify a set of
                      algorithms, and the connection will use an algorithm
                      supported by both client and server. It picks zlib if
                      both client and server support it; otherwise it picks
                      zstd if both support it; otherwise it picks uncompressed
                      if both support it; otherwise it fails.
  --query-alloc-block-size=# 
                      Allocation block size for query parsing and execution
  --query-prealloc-size=# 
                      Persistent buffer for query parsing and execution
  --range-alloc-block-size=# 
                      Allocation block size for storing ranges during
                      optimization
  --range-optimizer-max-mem-size=# 
                      Maximum amount of memory used by the range optimizer to
                      allocate predicates during range analysis. The larger the
                      number, more memory may be consumed during range
                      analysis. If the value is too low to completed range
                      optimization of a query, index range scan will not be
                      considered for this query. A value of 0 means range
                      optimizer does not have any cap on memory. 
  --read-buffer-size=# 
                      Each thread that does a sequential scan allocates a
                      buffer of this size for each table it scans. If you do
                      many sequential scans, you may want to increase this
                      value
  --read-only         Make all non-temporary tables read-only, with the
                      exception for replication applier threads and users with
                      the SUPER privilege.
  --read-rnd-buffer-size=# 
                      When reading rows in sorted order after a sort, the rows
                      are read through this buffer to avoid a disk seeks
  --regexp-stack-limit=# 
                      Stack size limit for regular expressions matches
  --regexp-time-limit=# 
                      Timeout for regular expressions matches, in steps of the
                      match engine, typically on the order of milliseconds.
  --relay-log=name    The location and name to use for relay logs
  --relay-log-index=name 
                      File that holds the names for relay log files.
  --relay-log-info-file=name 
                      The location and name of the file that remembers where
                      the SQL replication thread is in the relay logs
  --relay-log-info-repository=name 
                      Defines the type of the repository for the relay log
                      information and associated workers.
  --relay-log-purge   if disabled - do not purge relay logs. if enabled - purge
                      them as soon as they are no more needed
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-relay-log-purge to disable.)
  --relay-log-recovery 
                      If enabled, existing relay logs will be skipped by the
                      replication threads. The receiver will start a new relay
                      log and the applier will start reading from the beginning
                      of that file. The receiver's position relative to the
                      source will be reset to the applier's position relative
                      to the source; the receiver uses this in case
                      SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=0.
  --relay-log-space-limit=# 
                      Maximum space to use for all relay logs
  --replica-allow-batching 
                      Allow this replica to batch requests when using the NDB
                      storage engine.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-replica-allow-batching to disable.)
  --replica-checkpoint-group=# 
                      When using multi-threaded applier
                      (replica_parallel_workers>0), it will update the worker
                      progress status periodically. This option specifies the
                      maximum number of committed transactions between updates.
  --replica-checkpoint-period=# 
                      When using a multi-threaded applier
                      (replica_parallel_workers>0), it will update the worker
                      progress status periodically. This option specifies the
                      maximum number of milliseconds between updates.
  --replica-compressed-protocol 
                      Use compression in the source/replica protocol.
  --replica-exec-mode=name 
                      Modes for how replication events should be executed.
                      Legal values are STRICT (default) and IDEMPOTENT. In
                      IDEMPOTENT mode, replication will ignore duplicate key
                      errors and key not found errors. In STRICT mode,
                      replication will stop at those errors.
  --replica-load-tmpdir=name 
                      The location where this replica will store temporary
                      files when replicating a LOAD DATA INFILE command from a
                      source having binlog_format=STATEMENT.
  --replica-max-allowed-packet=# 
                      The maximum size of packets sent from an upstream source
                      server to this server.
  --replica-net-timeout=# 
                      Number of seconds to wait for more data from a
                      replication connection before aborting the read.
  --replica-parallel-type=name 
                      The method used by the replication applier to parallelize
                      transactions. DATABASE, indicates that it may apply
                      transactions in parallel in case they update different
                      databases. LOGICAL_CLOCK, which is the default, indicates
                      that it decides whether two transactions can be applied
                      in parallel using the logical timestamps computed by the
                      source, according to
                      binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking.
  --replica-parallel-workers=# 
                      Number of worker threads for executing events in parallel
                      
  --replica-pending-jobs-size-max=# 
                      Soft limit on the size, in bytes, of per-worker queues of
                      events that have not yet been applied. The queue size may
                      exceed this limit in case a single event is bigger than
                      the limit.
  --replica-preserve-commit-order 
                      Force replication worker threads to commit in the same
                      order as on the source. Enabled by default
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-replica-preserve-commit-order to disable.)
  --replica-skip-errors=name 
                      Comma-separated list of error numbers. If an applier
                      thread on this replica encounters one of these errors
                      while applying a Query_log_event, it will ignore the
                      error, rather than stop.
  --replica-sql-verify-checksum 
                      Force checksum verification of replication events after
                      reading them from relay log. Note: The replica always
                      verifies checksums for events received from the network,
                      if the event has a checksum at all, before it writes the
                      event to the relay log. Enabled by default.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-replica-sql-verify-checksum to disable.)
  --replica-transaction-retries=# 
                      Number of times the replication applier will retry a
                      transaction in case it failed with a deadlock or other
                      transient error, before it gives up and stops.
  --replica-type-conversions=name 
                      Set of type conversions that may be used by the
                      replication applier thread for row events. Allowed values
                      are: ALL_LOSSY to enable lossy conversions, ALL_NON_LOSSY
                      to enable non-lossy conversions, ALL_UNSIGNED to treat
                      all integer column type data to be unsigned values, and
                      ALL_SIGNED to treat all integer column type data to be
                      signed values. Default treatment is ALL_SIGNED. If
                      ALL_SIGNED and ALL_UNSIGNED both are specified,
                      ALL_SIGNED will take higher priority than ALL_UNSIGNED.
                      If the variable is assigned the empty set, no conversions
                      are allowed and it is expected that the types match
                      exactly.
  --replicate-do-db=name 
                      Make replication applier threads apply only changes to
                      the specified database. To specify more than one
                      database, use the directive multiple times, once for each
                      database. Note that this will only work if you do not use
                      cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
                      SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
                      database. If you need cross database updates to work,
                      make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
  --replicate-do-table=name 
                      Make replication applier threads apply only changes to
                      the specified table. To specify more than one table, use
                      the directive multiple times, once for each table. This
                      will work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-do-db.
  --replicate-ignore-db=name 
                      Make replication applier threads skip changes to the
                      specified database. To specify more than one database to
                      ignore, use this option multiple times, once for each
                      database. If there are statements that update multiple
                      databases, this will work correctly only when the source
                      server uses binlog_format=ROW.
  --replicate-ignore-table=name 
                      Make replication applier threads skip changes to the
                      specified table.To ignore more than one table, use the
                      option multiple times, once for each table. If there are
                      statements that update multiple tables, this will work
                      correctly only when the source server uses
                      binlog_format=ROW.
  --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
                      Make replication applier threads rename a database, so
                      changes in one database on the source will be applied in
                      another database on this replica. Example:
                      replicate-rewrite-db=source_db_name->replica_db_name.
  --replicate-same-server-id 
                      In replication, if set to 1, do not skip events having
                      our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
                      loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
                      --log-replica-updates is used.
  --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
                      Make replication applier threads apply changes only in
                      tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
                      specify more than one pattern, use the option multiple
                      times, once for each pattern. If there are statements
                      that update both tables that are included and excluded by
                      the pattern, this will only work correctly when the
                      source server uses binlog_format=ROW. Example:
                      replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
                      updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
                      and whose table names start with bar.
  --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
                      Make replication applier threads skip changes to tables
                      that match the specified wildcard pattern. To specify
                      more than one pattern, use the option multiple times,
                      once for each pattern. If there are statements that
                      update both tables that are included and tables that are
                      excluded by the pattern, this will only work correctly
                      when the source server uses binlog_format=ROW. Example:
                      when using replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar%, the
                      applier thread will not apply updates to tables in
                      databases that start with foo and whose table names start
                      with bar.
  --replication-optimize-for-static-plugin-config 
                      Optional flag that blocks plugin install/uninstall and
                      allows skipping the acquisition of the lock to read from
                      the plugin list and the usage of read-optimized
                      spin-locks. Use only when plugin hook callback needs
                      optimization (a lot of semi-sync replicas, for instance).
  --replication-sender-observe-commit-only 
                      Optional flag that allows for only calling back observer
                      hooks at commit.
  --report-host=name  Hostname or IP that this replica will report to the
                      source while initiating the replication connection. Will
                      appear in the output of SHOW REPLICAS. Leave this unset
                      if you do not want the replica to register itself with
                      the source. Note that it is not sufficient for the source
                      to simply read the IP of the replica off the socket once
                      the replica connects: in the presence of NAT other
                      routing features, that IP may not be valid for connecting
                      to the replica from the source or other hosts.
  --report-password=name 
                      The account password that this replica will report to the
                      source while initiating the replication connection.
  --report-port=#     The port for connecting to the replica, which this
                      replica will report to the source while initiating the
                      replication connection. Set it only if the replica is
                      listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
                      tunnel from the source or other clients to this replica.
                      If not sure, leave this option unset.
  --report-user=name  The account user name that this replica will report to
                      the source while initiating the replication connection.
  --require-secure-transport 
                      When this option is enabled, connections attempted using
                      insecure transport will be rejected.  Secure transports
                      are SSL/TLS, Unix socket or Shared Memory (on Windows).
  --rpl-read-size=#   The size for reads done from the binlog and relay log. It
                      must be a multiple of 4kb. Making it larger might help
                      with IO stalls while reading these files when they are
                      not in the OS buffer cache
  --rpl-stop-replica-timeout=# 
                      Timeout in seconds to wait for replication threads to
                      stop, before STOP REPLICA returns a warning.
  --rpl-stop-slave-timeout=# 
                      This option is deprecated. Use rpl_stop_replica_timeout
                      instead.
  --safe-user-create  Don't allow new user creation by the user who has no
                      write privileges to the mysql.user table.
  --schema-definition-cache=# 
                      The number of cached schema definitions
  --secondary-engine-cost-threshold[=#] 
                      Controls which statements to consider for execution in a
                      secondary storage engine. Only statements that have a
                      cost estimate higher than this value will be attempted
                      executed in a secondary storage engine.
  --secure-file-priv=name 
                      Limit LOAD DATA, SELECT ... OUTFILE, and LOAD_FILE() to
                      files within specified directory
  --select-into-buffer-size[=#] 
                      Buffer size for SELECT INTO OUTFILE/DUMPFILE.
  --select-into-disk-sync 
                      Synchronize flushed buffer with disk for SELECT INTO
                      OUTFILE/DUMPFILE.
  --select-into-disk-sync-delay[=#] 
                      The delay in milliseconds after each buffer sync for
                      SELECT INTO OUTFILE/DUMPFILE. Requires
                      select_into_sync_disk = ON.
  --server-id=#       Uniquely identifies the server instance in the community
                      of replication partners
  --server-id-bits=#  Set number of significant bits in server-id
  --session-track-gtids=name 
                      Controls the amount of global transaction ids to be

  -v, --verbose       Used with --help option for detailed help.
  -V, --version       Output version information and exit.
  --wait-timeout=#    The number of seconds the server waits for activity on a
                      connection before closing it
  --windowing-use-high-precision 
                      For SQL window functions, determines whether to enable
                      inversion optimization for moving window frames also for
                      floating values.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-windowing-use-high-precision to disable.)
  --xa-detach-on-prepare 
                      When set, XA transactions will be detached (AKA
                      dissociated or disconnected) from connection as part of
                      XA PREPARE. This means that the XA transaction can be
                      committed/rolled back by any connection, even if the
                      starting connection has not terminated, and the starting
                      connection can start new transactions. As a side effect,
                      temporary tables cannot be used inside XA transactions.
                      When disabled, XA transactions are associated with the
                      same connection until the session disconnects. ON is the
                      only safe choice for replication.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-xa-detach-on-prepare to disable.)
